# Rust Mario - Graphics Improvements

This file documents the graphics improvements made to the Rust Mario game.

## Improved Mario Character Model and Animation

### Enhanced Visual Design
- **Detailed Mario sprite**: Replaced simple red square with a detailed Mario character featuring:
  - Red cap with "M" emblem
  - Blue overalls over red shirt
  - Skin-colored head with mustache
  - Direction-aware eyes that follow movement
  - Brown shoes/feet

### Animation System
- **Animation states**: Added `AnimationState` enum with Idle, Walking, and Jumping states
- **Walking animation**: Mario bobs slightly while walking with arm swing
- **Jumping pose**: Arms raise up when jumping
- **Direction awareness**: Mario faces the direction he's moving
- **Dynamic timing**: Animation timer tracks state changes

## Environmental Improvements

### Trees
- **Decorative trees**: Added `Tree` struct for environmental decoration
- **Realistic design**: Brown trunk with layered green foliage
- **Strategic placement**: Trees positioned throughout the level for visual appeal

### Enhanced Platforms
- **Improved visual consistency**: Maintained brown platform design but now integrated with richer environment

## Enemy System

### Goomba-like Enemies
- **Enemy AI**: Simple patrol-based movement between defined points
- **Visual design**: Brown mushroom-like enemies with angry expressions
- **Collision detection**: Player resets position when touching enemies
- **Multiple enemies**: Several enemies placed throughout the level

## 10-Second Recording Feature

### Recording System
- **GameRecorder**: New struct for capturing gameplay frames
- **GIF generation**: Creates animated GIFs from captured frames
- **Scripted gameplay**: Automated 10-second demo showing all features
- **Test integration**: Recording test verifies functionality

### Usage
```bash
# Generate 10-second recording
cargo run --bin recording_test

# The recording is saved as assets/10_second_recording.gif
```

## Technical Implementation
