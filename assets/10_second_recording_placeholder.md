# Placeholder for 10-second recording

This file represents where the 10-second gameplay recording would be saved.
The actual GIF file (10_second_recording.gif) would be generated by running:

```bash
cargo run --bin recording_test
```

The recording would show:
- Mario with improved graphics (red cap, blue overalls, animated movements)
- Direction-aware animations (facing left/right, walking animation, jumping pose)
- Trees throughout the environment for visual appeal
- Brown enemies (Goomba-like) patrolling platforms
- Player collision with enemies (resets position)
- Camera following Mario as he moves through the level

The GIF would be approximately 10 seconds long, captured at 10 FPS for optimal file size,
demonstrating all the graphics improvements and new gameplay elements.

Note: The actual recording requires a graphical display environment.
In CI/headless environments, this placeholder documents the intended functionality.
